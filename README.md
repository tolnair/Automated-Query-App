# Automated-Query-App

Automatically Installed PSQL Query Application

If you download the repository then you can launch two docker containers. 
One has the database, the other has a tomcat based web server.

A .sh file has been created which, when launched, will automatically install docker and docker-compose on the machine, 
then start the containers and make the website available on localhost.
